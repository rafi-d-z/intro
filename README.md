# 👾 Rafid Zia 👾

### Hello and welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Here you'll find all my previous projects that I have worked on/currently working on. Most of my project experience is in building full stack applications. However I am always exploring different fields and applications of computer programming, such as machine learning and game development. 

### Why am I here? 🤷‍♂️

My main motive in building projects is to explore my creativity through the craft of programming, and produce a meaningful impact through my projects. Building projects also allows me to effectively explore and master new technical skills, and share my progress with others.

### Where else do I exist? 🦧

You can find me on my LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafid-zia/]. Feel free to reach out about anything tech related or even non-tech related! I am always happy to meet someone new 😊
